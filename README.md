Studio Electronics - BTU Talking Drum
University of Colorado, ATLAS Institute

In times past, how do people from the Western part of Nigeria communicate over a long distance? This question led to the convesation around the Sub Sahara African Talking Drum and the uses of the drum for more than entertainment was mostly amusing to us. 

The question led us to trying out an interaction project with the talking drum so as to introduce more people to the Talking drum and how it produces its sound. As every art project must come with a user centric interaction methods, we explore the use of mechanical control and arduino to enable users to interact with the drum. 

And this journey set a pace for inspecting our knowledge of electronics and interaction design as a methods of introducing the drum to more students users at the University of Colorado Boulder. 

While this is a work in progress which will later be examined in the future by one of the project team member, it should be of note here that the project satisfactorily invited more people who tried interacting with the drum during ATLAS Expo in the Spring of 2018.
